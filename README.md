# Pet Clinic
This is an example project that serves as an introduction to simplity (http:////). It is based on the Pet Clinic Example(http:///)

Simplest way to start would be just clone this and use it as a Dynamic Web Project in eclipse. WebComponent folder is ready to be run as a project under a web-container like tomcat. However, since this example uses database, you have to set up your rdbms before running it.
